Massa: The Decentralized and Scaled Blockchain
==============================================

Massa is a truly decentralized blockchain controlled by thousands of
people. With the breakthrough multithreaded technology, we're set for
mass adoption.

Introduction
------------

`Massa <https://massa.net>`_ is a new blockchain reaching a high
transaction throughput in a decentralized network. Our research is
published in this `technical paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09029>`_.
It shows that throughput of 10'000 transactions per second is reached
even in a fully decentralized network with thousands of nodes.

An easy-to-read blog post introduction with videos is written
`here <https://massa.net/blog/post/0/>`_.

Testnet
-------

As decentralization is our core value, we would like to help you start
and run a Massa node on our testnet. You'll find a full tutorial on how
to install and stake with your node on our testnet :ref:`here <testnet-install>`.

Smart-contracts
---------------

If you are interested in Massa smart-contract engine, you'll find a general
introduction to the Massa's smart-contract engine :ref:`here <sc-introduction>`.

If you want to build smart-contract or interact with smart-contracts on the Massa
blockchain we recommend the following ressources:

- :ref:`Getting started<sc-getting-started>` tutorial, will get you through the various steps needed to compile and upload smart-contracts.
- :ref:`Massa's smart-contract by example <sc-example>` a more advanced tutorial, that goes through all the steps needed to build a decentralized application using Massa's smart-contracts and Massa's decentralized web.
- :ref:`Massa's decentralized web <sc-example>` tutorial explains how the Massa blockchain can be used to host decentralized websites.
- :ref:`Types <sc-types>` a collection of useful types for smart-contracts.

Technical ressources
--------------------

You'll find :ref:`here <technical-api>` the documentation of the various JSON-RPC API endpoints exposed by a Massa node.
