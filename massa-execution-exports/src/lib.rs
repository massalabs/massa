//! # Overview
//!
//! This crate provides all the facilities to interact with a running execution worker (massa-execution-worker crate)
//! that is in charge of executing operations in a virtual machine,
//! and applying the effects of the execution to a ledger.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! When an execution worker is launched to run in a separate thread for the whole duration of the process,
//! an instance of `ExecutionManager` is returned (see the documentation of `start_execution_worker` in `massa-execution-worker`),
//! as well as an instance of `ExecutionController`.
//!
//! The non-clonable `ExecutionManager` allows stopping the execution worker thread.
//!
//! The clonable `ExecutionController` allows sending updates on the latest blockclique changes to the execution worker
//! for it to keep track of them and execute the operations present in blocks.
//! It also allows various read-only queries such as executing bytecode
//! while ignoring all the changes it would cause to the consensus state (read-only execution),
//! or reading the state at the output of the executed blockclique blocks.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ## `config.rs`
//! Contains configuration parameters for the execution system.
//!
//! ## `controller_traits.rs`
//! Defines the `ExecutionManager` and `ExecutionController` traits for interacting with the execution worker.
//!
//! ## `errors.rs`
//! Defines error types for the crate.
//!
//! ## `event_store.rs`
//! Defines an indexed, finite-size storage system for execution events.
//!
//! ## `types.rs`
//! Defines useful shared structures.
//!
//! ## Test exports
//!
//! When the crate feature `test-exports` is enabled, tooling useful for test-exports purposes is exported.
//! See `test_exports/mod.rs` for details.
//!
//! # Execution trace
//!
//! See documentation in types_trace_info.rs file.
